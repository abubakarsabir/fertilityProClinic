# Fertility Pro

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

## Getting Started

1. **Delete Existing Dependencies**

   If you've previously installed dependencies, ensure you delete the `node_modules` directory to start afresh:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   With the above steps, the project should be set up smoothly without any conflicting dependencies.

3. **Run the application**

   ```

   Or you can run the tests from the CLI:

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```
